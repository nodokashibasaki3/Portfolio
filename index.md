## About Me

I am a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I am currently a research assistant in the [RIVeR Lab](https://robot.neu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of Professor [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/){:target="\_blank"}.

Through many guidance both in industry and academia, I have gained full-stack knowledge in robotics from low-level control to high-level planning. 

I gained valuable industry experience as a Robotics intern at [OMRON](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/){:target="\_blank"} where I worked on contact-rich manipulation projects, as well as at [KAIKAKU](https://www.kaikaku.ai/){:target="\_blank"} where I worked extensively with ToF cameras. I had the opportunity to develop autonomous multi-modal locomotion robots at the [Silicon Synapses Lab](https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Ramezani Alireza](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/){:target="\_blank"}, and uncertainty-aware exoskeletons at the [Shepherd's Lab](https://shepherdlab.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-max/){:target="_blank"}.
