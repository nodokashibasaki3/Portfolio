## About Me

I am a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with a strong intent to pursue robotics. I am currently a research assistant in the RiVER Lab under the supervision of Professor [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/){:target="\_blank"}, where I research on **manipulation, perception, and control systems** for wheel-chair and Human Support Robot (HSR) from Toyota Research Institute (TRI).

My interest in robotics has developed through hands-on research across different application areas. I studied autonomous driving and control systems at the [Silicon Synapses Lab](https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Ramezani Alireza](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/){:target="\_blank"}, working on a multi-modal locomotion robot. I also studied **control systems and human–robot interaction** at the [Shepherd's Lab](https://shepherdlab.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-max/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked on an uncertainty-aware exoskeleton.

More recently, I interned full-time for six months at [OMRON SINIC X](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/){:target="\_blank"} in Tokyo, focusing on ** robot learning and manipulation** for soft robotic systems. My research is motivated by the goal of enabling humans to seamlessly and safely work together with robots in their daily lives.

My early work in athletic training and at [Stanford Sports Medicine Lab](https://sportsmedicine.stanford.edu/){:target="\_blank"} initially drew me toward biomechanics and pre-med. But as I began working on rehabilitation robotics in college, I found myself more captivated by the engineering challenge of creating adaptive systems that work with human capabilities. I'm interested in developing safe, adaptive and replicable robotic systems that enable intuitive human-robot collaboration.

**Fields of Interest:** Robot Manipulation, Robot Control, Human-Robot Collaboration
