## About Me

I am a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with a strong intent to pursue robotics. I am currently a research assistant in the RiVER Lab under the supervision of Professor [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/){:target="\_blank"}, where I research on manipulation, perception, and control systems.

My interest in robotics has solidified thanks to many guidances. I had the opportunity to develop autonomous multi-modal locomotion robots at the [Silicon Synapses Lab](https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Ramezani Alireza](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/){:target="\_blank"}, and uncertainty-aware exoskeletons at the [Shepherd's Lab](https://shepherdlab.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-max/){:target="\_blank"}.

I also gained valuable industry research experience as a full-time intern for six months at [OMRON SINIC X](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/){:target="\_blank"} in Tokyo. My work is motivated by the goal of enabling humans to seamlessly and safely work together with robots in their daily lives.

**Extra:** My early work in athletic training and at [Stanford Sports Medicine Lab](https://sportsmedicine.stanford.edu/){:target="\_blank"} initially drew me toward biomechanics and pre-med. But as I began working on assistive robotics in college, I found myself more captivated by the engineering challenge of creating adaptive systems that work with human capabilities. I'm interested in developing safe, adaptive and replicable robotic systems that enable intuitive human-robot collaboration.
