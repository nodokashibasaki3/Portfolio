## About Me

I'm a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} studying robotics and control. Currently, I am a research assistant at RiVER lab under the guidance of Professor [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/){:target="\_blank"}. I was interning at [OMRON SINIC X](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/){:target="\_blank"} in Tokyo working on soft robotics learning and control. During my undergrad, I've conducted research at [Silicon Synapses Lab](https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with Professor [Ramezani Alireza](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/){:target="\_blank"} in Autonomous Driving and Control System of a Multi-Modal Locomotion Robot. At [Shepherd's Lab](https://shepherdlab.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with Professor [Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-max/){:target="\_blank"}, I worked on Exoskeleton Assistive Technology and Human-Robot Interaction Research. My research is motivated by the goal of enabling humans to seamlessly and safely work together with robots in their daily lives.

My early work in athletic training and at [Stanford Sports Medicine Lab](https://sportsmedicine.stanford.edu/){:target="\_blank"} initially drew me toward biomechanics and pre-med. But as I began working on rehabilitation robotics in college, I found myself more captivated by the engineering challenge of creating adaptive systems that work with human capabilities. I'm interested in developing safe, adaptive and replicable robotic systems that enable intuitive human-robot collaboration.

**Fields of Interest:** Robot Manipulation, Robot Control, Human-Robot Collaboration
