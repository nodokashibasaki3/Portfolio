## About Me

I am a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with a strong intent to pursue robotics. I am currently a research assistant in the RiVER Lab under the supervision of Professor [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/){:target="\_blank"}, where I work on manipulation, perception, and control systems for wheel-chair and Human Support Robot (HSR) from Toyota Research Institute (TRI).

My interest in robotics has developed through hands-on research across different application areas. I studied autonomous driving and control systems at the [Silicon Synapses Lab](https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Ramezani Alireza](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/){:target="\_blank"}, working on a multi-modal locomotion robot. I also studied assistive robotics and human–robot interaction at the [Shepherd's Lab](https://shepherdlab.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-max/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked on an uncertainty-aware exoskeleton.

More recently, I interned full-time for six months at [OMRON SINIC X](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/){:target="\_blank"} in Tokyo, focusing on learning and control for soft robotic systems. Across these experiences, I have become increasingly motivated by the challenge of designing robots that can interact with people safely, intuitively, and reliably in real-world settings.

**Fields of Interest:** Robot Manipulation, Robot Control, Human-Robot Collaboration
