## About Me

I am a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with a strong intent to pursue robotics. I am currently a research assistant in the [RIVeR Lab](https://robot.neu.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of Professor [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/){:target="\_blank"}.

My interest in robotics has solidified thanks to many guidances. I had the opportunity to develop autonomous multi-modal locomotion robots at the [Silicon Synapses Lab](https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Ramezani Alireza](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/){:target="\_blank"}, and uncertainty-aware exoskeletons at the [Shepherd's Lab](https://shepherdlab.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} under Professor [Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-max/){:target="\_blank"}.

I also gained valuable industry research experience as a full-time intern for six months at [OMRON SINIC X](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/){:target="\_blank"} in Tokyo.
