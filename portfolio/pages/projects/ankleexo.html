        <h1>Ankle Exoskeleton Research</h1>
        <p>For the ankle exoskeleton research, I focused on enhancing and extending the functionality of machine learning algorithms for gait analysis. I coded in Python to debug and optimize pre-existing code, which had significant inefficiencies and errors, improving its computational performance and reliability. Initially limited to offline data processing, I restructured and adapted the code to support real-time online data streams, enabling seamless integration of both pre-recorded and live data analysis. To facilitate user control, I implemented a robust configuration file system, allowing researchers to switch effortlessly between offline and online analysis modes.</p>
        <p>In addition to software development, I contributed to the hardware design by creating a custom electronics mounting plate. This design integrated key components, including the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi for on-board data processing, alongside a battery pack for power management. The plate was engineered to optimize spatial efficiency and maintain secure connections, ensuring reliable operation during dynamic exoskeleton use.</p>
        <p>By bridging hardware and software, I enhanced the exoskeleton’s capabilities for real-time data analysis and operational flexibility. This work not only improved the system’s efficiency but also refined its usability for rehabilitation and research applications. Through this experience, I developed advanced skills in <b>Python</b>, <b>machine learning adaptation</b>, <b>hardware design</b>, and <b>wearable robotics</b>.</p>
