        <h1>Hip Exoskeleton Research</h1>
        <p>During my time working on hip exoskeleton research, I focused on improving the design and functionality of the device to enhance mobility for users. My contributions included calibrating sensors to ensure accurate data collection and assembling wiring to create a reliable system for operation.</p>
        <p><b>Throughout this project, I was able to learn PCB design, circuits and signal design, soldering and the use of detachable connectors.</b></p>
        <p>This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of wearable robotics and gain hands-on experience in both hardware and software aspects of the project. It also highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary teamwork and attention to detail in developing assistive technologies that can make a tangible difference in peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
