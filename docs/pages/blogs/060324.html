        <h1>Running again... but actually!!</h1>
        <h2>06/03/24</h2>
        <p>Since my injury in Sophomore year, I have been disconnected from running. I would run now and there
            but I never had a goal (e.g. upcoming race) to train for. I would run average of 20 miles per week (mpw)
            and call it a day. But now I have a goal to run the Boston Marathon my fourth year, and achieve a BQ time
            by September of 2025. This means I have a year to train.
        </p>

        <p>
            This motivation led to my extensive research on running training which surprisingly I never did before because I always have
            relied on a coach to do that besides reading the Jack Daniels' Running Formula and a few human physiology books
            here and there.

            And here are top a few things I have been doing wrong: <br>
            <b>1. running as hard as I can with no easy runs:</b> I run distance runs ranging from 3 to 8 miles now and not once did I 
            take my runs "easy" that is because I assumed, the faster I run on regular basis the faster I would run in races. Well,
            turns out this was completely wrong, and easy runs are super important! Especially because I might not have the base
            to run 40 mpw (should be able to do this before starting to train for a marathon), I plan to continue with easy runs
            and no running workouts until I get to where I could run at sub 8 min pace at 75% HRMAx.<br>
            <b>2. Keeping track of my heart rate is important:</b> For
