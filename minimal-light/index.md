## About Me

I'm a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} studying robotics and control. I'm currently interning at [OMRON SINIC X](https://www.omron.com/sinicx/){:target="\_blank"} in Tokyo working on soft robotics learning and control. Currently, I am a Master's student at the University of Michigan. I am a member of the [Locomotion and Active Perception Lab (ROAHM Lab)](https://roahmlab.engin.umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Ram Vasudevan](https://roahmlab.engin.umich.edu/people/ram-vasudevan). During my undergrad, I've conducted research at [Silicon Synapses Lab](https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with Professor [Ramezani Alireza](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/ramezani-alireza/){:target="\_blank"} and at [Shepherd's Lab](https://shepherdlab.sites.northeastern.edu/){:target="\_blank"} with Professor [Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-max/){:target="\_blank"}. My research is motivated by the goal of enabling humans to seamlessly and safely work together with robots in their daily lives.

My early work in athletic training and at [Stanford Sports Medicine Lab](https://sportsmedicine.stanford.edu/){:target="\_blank"} initially drew me toward biomechanics and pre-med. But as I began working on rehabilitation robotics in college, I found myself more captivated by the engineering challenge of creating adaptive systems that work with human capabilities. I'm interested in developing safe, adaptive and replicable robotic systems that enable intuitive human-robot collaboration.

**Research Interests:** Robotic Learning, Sim-to-Real Transfer, Robotic Systems, Control Systems
