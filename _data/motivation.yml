But as I began working on assistive robotics in college, I found myself more <span style="background-color: #FAA152; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 2px;">captivated by solving the challenge of creating adaptive systems that work with human capabilities in a open world setting.</span> I am especially interested in tackling this through reinforcement learning, and multi-modal sensory integration.
