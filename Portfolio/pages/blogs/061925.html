        <p>Before joining the lab, I didn't know what a robot was. I barely knew anything.</p>
        <p>I had some experience with machine learning and motion capture software, which helped me get the research assistant position. I reached out to Max, the PI of Shepherd Lab, because the lab focused on biomechanics and robotics, which matched my interests.</p>
        <p>My first project involved power wiring for a hip exoskeleton. I had only done basic Arduino circuits and didn't know how to use fuses, Dupont connectors, soldering tools, or crimpers. I learned everything from scratch and built a working circuit.</p>
        <p>In the second project, I debugged a machine learning algorithm using the teacher-student method. The loss was high, but I improved it by implementing LOSO and using clean data from the Qualisys motion capture system. Accuracy rose to 98 percent, with a 200 percent performance improvement.</p>
        <p>For the third project, I designed a CAD backplate for the ankle exoskeleton. The original prototype had flaws and required tape to hold wires. I created a modular backplate with a hip curve and clean wire routing.</p>
        <p>Through these projects, I gained skills in electronics, software, and mechanical design. I also learned from researchers with backgrounds in biology and engineering. Everyone was kind and always greeted me on campus.</p>
        <p>This lab made me love robotics. I'm grateful for the experience and wish them all the best.</p>
