        <h1>Hip Exoskeleton Research</h1>
        
        <h2>Goal: Biomechanically-Informed Torque Control for Hip Exoskeleton Performance Enhancement</h2>
        <p>The overarching goal of this research is to develop a highly effective torque control strategy for a hip exoskeleton. This strategy aims to achieve a dual objective: first, to <b>minimize the metabolic cost </b>for the user during locomotion, thereby improving energy efficiency and reducing user exertion; and second, to <b>maximize user preference</b> by ensuring the exoskeleton assistance feels natural, comfortable, and effectively supports their intended movements. Achieving this balance is crucial for creating wearable robotic systems that are not only energy-efficient but also seamlessly integrated and accepted by users, promoting wider adoption and real-world impact in areas such as <b>rehabilitation, mobility assistance for elderly or individuals with disabilities, or even human performance augmentation in industrial/logistics settings</b>. This goal necessitates a deep understanding of biomechanics, robust data acquisition, and advanced control algorithms.</p>

        <h2>My Contribution: Optimizing Motion Capture Data Quality through Marker Placement Refinement and Algorithmic Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>Recognizing the limitations imposed by the initial marker placement, my primary contribution was to <b>address the suboptimal marker configuration proactively.</b> This involved two key actions: <br><br>
            <b>Development of a Data Sorting and Cleaning Algorithm:</b> To further enhance data quality and address potential artifacts or noise inherent in motion capture data, I <b>designed and implemented a custom data sorting and cleaning algorithm.</b> This algorithm coded in Python interpolation methods, filtering techniques, outlier detection methods within the algorithm]. This algorithm ensured that the motion capture data was of sufficient quality for subsequent biomechanical analysis and model training.</p>
