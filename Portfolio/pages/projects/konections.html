        <h1>Konections in Japanese</h1>
        <p>This project is javascript-based game based off of New York Times' viral game, Connections, in Japanese. The goal of the game is to "Group words that share a common thread" (NYT). I named the game originally named "Connections" with a K since in Japanese Roman Lettering, often K is used instead of C.</p>
