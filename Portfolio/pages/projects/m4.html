    <h1>Multi Modal Locomotion Robot</h1>

    <h2>üèÅGoal: Migrating to ROS2 for Advanced Autonomous Navigation Simulation of the M4 Multi-Modal Robot</h2>
    <p>The primary goal of this project was to establish a robust and future-proof simulation environment for autonomous navigation and path planning of the M4 multi-modal robot. This was achieved by migrating the existing simulation framework from ROS1 to ROS2 and implementing it within the Gazebo simulation platform. The focus was specifically on the M4 platform, a <b>custom-built wheeled-aerial robot</b>, to enable development and testing of advanced autonomous locomotion algorithms in a realistic simulated environment. This transition to ROS2 is crucial for <b>ensuring scalability and future extensibility of the simulation framework.</b></p>
    
    <h2>Problem Statement: Addressing Limitations of ROS1 and Ensuring Future Scalability for Autonomous Systems Development    </h2>
    <p>The primary motivation for this project was the <b>impending inactivation of ROS1</b> and its inherent limitations for advanced robotics development. ROS1, while widely adopted, is <b>not optimally designed for distributed decision-making systems</b> and lacks the robust features required for complex, multi-agent robotic applications. This presented a significant challenge because <b>ROS1 would lead to compatibility issues with future robotic platforms and software ecosystems. Long-term maintainability and support for the existing simulation framework would also be compromised.</b> Migrating to ROS2 became a critical imperative to ensure the long-term viability and scalability of the M4 robot's autonomous capabilities and research efforts.</p>

    <h2>My Contribution: Successful Migration of M4 Simulation to ROS2-Gazebo Environment    </h2>
    <p>My core contribution was the <b>successful migration of the existing M4 robot simulation from a ROS1-based framework to a modern ROS2-Gazebo environment.</b> This involved a comprehensive effort encompassing: <br>
        1. <b>ROS1 to ROS2 Code Porting:</b> Systematically porting and adapting existing ROS1 codebases to be compatible with ROS2, addressing API changes, message type conversions, and architectural differences between ROS versions.<br>
        2. <b>Gazebo Simulation Setup:</b> Rebuilding and configuring the M4 robot model and simulation environment within Gazebo, ensuring accurate representation of the robot's kinematics, dynamics, and sensor suite.<br>
        3. <b>Autonomous Navigation Stack Implementation:</b> Re-implementing and adapting the autonomous navigation and path planning algorithms within the ROS2-Gazebo environment, leveraging ROS2's Nav2 navigation framework and optimizing for the M4 platform's multi-modal locomotion capabilities.<br>
        4. <b>Testing and Validation:</b> Rigorous testing and validation of the migrated simulation environment to ensure functional equivalence with the ROS1 version and accurate representation of the M4 robot's behavior. This included <b>comparing simulation results with ROS1 version, and testing navigation performance in various simulated scenarios, etc.</b><p>
        
    <h2>Results & Next Steps: Future-Proof Simulation Platform for Advanced Autonomous Robotics Development    </h2>
    <p><b>Results: </b>The successful migration to ROS2-Gazebo resulted in a <b>fully functional and future-proof simulation platform</b> for the M4 multi-modal robot. This environment now enables <b>accelerated development and testing of autonomous navigation algorithms, robust validation of path planning strategies, efficient prototyping of new robot behaviors in simulation before real-world deployment, etc.</b></p>
    <p><b>Next Steps:</b> The immediate next step is to leverage this ROS2-Gazebo simulation environment to <b>advance research in autonomous decision-making for multi-modal robots.</b> This includes: <br>
        üöÄ<b>Developing and implementing advanced decision-making algorithms</b> for the M4 robot, focusing on <b>hierarchical decision-making and reinforcement learning for navigation in complex environments</b>.<br>
