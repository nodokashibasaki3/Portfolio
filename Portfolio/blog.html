                I used to think that the more I understood, the more things would make sense. That if I kept asking the right questions, life would eventually give me a clear answer. But it doesn't work like that. Strangely, the closer I get to something that feels like purpose, the more uncertain I become. Like chasing something in the fogâ€”the shape is there, but the moment you reach out, it slips away.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
                Still, I don't think that's a bad thing. Maybe we're not meant to arrive anywhere too quickly. Maybe it's enough to notice the moments that feel right, even if we can't explain them. I wrote a poem about that feeling of quiet, flickering sense of direction that never quite stays still.

                Built a Discord bot that sorts users into cabin groups and gives them access to group-specific text chats. Cabin leaders get added to a separate leader chat. Learned discord.py, GitHub workflows, and Railway deployment along the way.

            <h2>The Search for Happiness in a Digital Age</h2>

                Reflections on how social media creates unachievable requirements for contentment and the realization that happiness is less about reaching a destination and more about embracing our unique paths and detours.
